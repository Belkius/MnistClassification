# Exploration of Classification Algorithms with MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to explore various classification algorithms for educational purposes using the MNIST dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset. 
It is a dataset of 70,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. 
The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

## Models
The following classification algorithms are explored in this project:
1. SGD Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

## Techniques Explored
- Cross-validation
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Tresholding
- ROC Curve
- Image Preprocessing
- Data Augmentation
